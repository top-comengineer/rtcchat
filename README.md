rtc chat
========

WebRTC peer-to-peer chat service written in Go

Q: What does it takes to connect two browsers, both behind NAT?<br/> 
A: A secret word.

<img style="margin-left:0px" src="rtcchat.png" /><br/>

Works with [Firefox 22+](http://getfirefox.com/) on the Desktop and with [Firefox 25+ on Android](http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mobile/nightly/latest-mozilla-central-android/).

Try out live rtcchat: [http://timur.mobi/rtcchat](http://timur.mobi/rtcchat/)

(Please note: my site is using a self-signed certificate.)

Features
--------

rtcchat...

- helps two browsers establish a direct data link
- p2p communication works over encrypted, reliable UDP
- comes with it's own STUN and signaling services
- no 3rd-party servers will be contacted

Run precompiled executable
--------------------------

No special environment needs to be installed. The precompiled executable is fully selfcontained.

	mkdir rtcchat
	cd rtcchat

Download: 

1. one of the precompiled executable binaries for your platform from: 
[http://github.com/mehrvarz/files](http://github.com/mehrvarz/files)
(click 'Raw')

2. the platform neutral web application archive:
[https://github.com/mehrvarz/files/raw/master/rtcchat-webroot.zip](https://github.com/mehrvarz/files/raw/master/rtcchat-webroot.zip)

Unzip both archives into the same new "rtcchat" folder.

Create keys for WebSocket signaling over https (see below).
Or run your executable with option: -secure=false

This is how your rtcchat folder should look like:

	rtcchat
		webroot
			index.html
			rtcchat.js
			...
		keys
			key.pem
			cert.pem
		rtcchat-darwin-amd64

Now run the executable:

	./rtcchat{-os-platform} [-options]

Run from source
---------------

Golang 1.1 needs to be installed.

	go get github.com/mehrvarz/rtcchat
	cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/mehrvarz/rtcchat

Create keys for WebSocket signaling over https (see below) or add option: -secure=false

	go run rtcchat/main.go [-options]

	
Server command line options
---------------------------

This tables shows command line options with their default values:

	-hostaddr="": set host ip address
	-sigport=8077: set signaling port
	-stunport=19253: set STUNs port
	-secure=true: set to false to allow signaling over http instead of https
	-webroot="webroot": set path to webroot

Create keys for WebSocket signaling over https
----------------------------------------------

	mkdir keys && cd keys
	openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout key.pem -days 100
	(answer questions)
	cd ..

Alternative: link to your existing keys froms /etc/nginx

	mkdir keys && cd keys
	ln -s /etc/nginx/cert.pem cert.pem
	ln -s /etc/nginx/key.pem key.pem
	cd ..

Please note: the "keys" subfolder is expected to contain two files: "cert.pem" and "key.pem".

Establish p2p connection
------------------------

Open Firefox on two devices and browse to: 

	https://{hostaddr}:8077/rtcchat
