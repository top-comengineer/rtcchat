rtc chat
========

A WebRTC peer-to-peer chat service written in Go

rtcchat helps two browsers establish a direct p2p data link.

Q: What does it take to connect two browsers, both behind NAT?<br/> 
A: One secret word.

rtc chat works with [Firefox 22+](http://getfirefox.com/) on the Desktop and with [Firefox 25+ on Android](http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mobile/nightly/latest-mozilla-central-android/).

Try it out: [live rtcchat](http://timur.mobi/rtcchat/) (site is using a self-signed certificate for https)

How does it work
----------------

- your browser will fetch the rtc chat web app and will switch to https
- the secret word you enter will be sent to the rtc chat server 
- because noone else is using your secret word currently, you have to wait
- the STUN service on the rtc chat server has already provided you with your public ip address
- now someone else is starting to use rtc chat and is entering the same secret word
- rtc chat will immediately provide your browser with this info, WebRTC signaling will now start
- your browser will generated a WebRTC offer and will send it to the rtc chat server
- rtc chat server will forward your WebRTC offer to the other party
- the other party will respond by sending back a WebRTC answer 
- as soon as your browser has received the WebRTC answer it will kill the server connection
- a direct p2p WebRTC will now be established
- p2p communication are done over encrypted, reliable UDP

What is special
---------------

Two things!

1. Unlike other WebRTC solutions, rtc chat client will NOT instruct your device 
to contact any 3rd party servers, say, in order to retrieve your devices own public IP address.
rtcchat comes with it's own STUN and signaling services.

2. Installation couldn't be easier. rtc chat server is 100% selfcontained (it's a single 
executable). And there are no requirements to install any programming languages or 3rd party frameworks. 

Run precompiled executable
--------------------------

	mkdir rtcchat
	cd rtcchat

1. Download one of the precompiled executable binaries from: 
[http://github.com/mehrvarz/files](http://github.com/mehrvarz/files)
(click 'Raw'). Executables are available for the following platforms: 
linux-amd64, linux-386, linux-arm, darwin-amd64 and windows-amd64.

2. Download the platform neutral web application:
[https://github.com/mehrvarz/files/raw/master/rtcchat-webroot.zip](https://github.com/mehrvarz/files/raw/master/rtcchat-webroot.zip)

3. Unzip both archives into one folder.

4. Create keys for WebSocket signaling over https (see below).
Or run your executable with option: -secure=false

This is how your rtcchat folder should look:

	rtcchat
		webroot
			index.html
			rtcchat.js
			adapter.js
			bootstrap.min.css
			...
		keys
			key.pem
			cert.pem
		rtcchat-darwin-amd64

Now run the executable:

	./rtcchat{-os-platform} [-options]

Run from source
---------------

Golang 1.1 needs to be installed.

	go get github.com/mehrvarz/rtcchat
	cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/mehrvarz/rtcchat

Create keys for WebSocket signaling over https (see below) or add option: -secure=false

Now you can run the main package:

	go run rtcchat/main.go [-options]

Server command line options
---------------------------

This tables shows command line options with their default values:

	-hostaddr="": set host ip address
	-sigport=8077: set signaling port
	-stunport=19253: set STUNs port
	-secure=true: set to false to allow signaling over http instead of https
	-webroot="webroot": set path to webroot

Create keys for WebSocket signaling over https
----------------------------------------------

	mkdir keys && cd keys
	openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout key.pem -days 100
	(answer questions)
	cd ..

Alternative: link to your existing keys froms /etc/nginx

	mkdir keys && cd keys
	ln -s /etc/nginx/cert.pem cert.pem
	ln -s /etc/nginx/key.pem key.pem
	cd ..

Please note: the "keys" subfolder is expected to contain two files: "cert.pem" and "key.pem".

Establish p2p connection
------------------------

Open two instances of Firefox and browse to: 

	https://{hostaddr}:8077/rtcchat
